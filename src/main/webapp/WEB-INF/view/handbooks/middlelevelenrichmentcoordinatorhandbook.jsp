<h1>Middle Level Enrichment Coordinator Handbook</h1>
<hr size="1">
<p>
    Thank you for volunteering your time to be the Enrichment Coordinator for the Middle Level grades. As the
    Enrichment Coordinator you will be working closely with the teacher and PTSA to coordinate guest speakers
    and outside programs that enrich what our kids are learning in the classroom. The PTSA has put together this
    manual to help guide you through the process.
</p>

<p>Thanks for making a difference.</p>

<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Basic Calendar</div>
<div style="font-weight:bold">September:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Send an email to the teachers in the teachers to introduce yourself and give them your contact
        information. Set up a time that you can meet with both teachers to go over classroom enrichment
        opportunity goals for the year and <b><u>about which month</u></b> they will need them. Keep in mind that
        outside
        programs that come into the school to do demonstrations could take time to set up and acquire funds.
    </li>
    <li>Send a letter (see sample letter at the back of handbook) in the Friday Folder introducing yourself to the
        parents and ask for a donation of $10.00 for a class enrichment fund to help pay for guest speakers and
        in school, grade level enrichment programs.
    </li>
    <li>Obtain a class email list from the classroom volunteer coordinator. Parents of students can be one of
        your best assets when looking for guest speakers.
    </li>
</ul>
<div style="font-weight:bold">September thru May:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Research each goal for enrichment that you have talked about with the teacher. If there are several
        different opportunities, email the teachers to let them decide which one would best meet their needs. If
        funds are required, talk with the teacher to see if there is enough money in the classroom enrichment
        fund or if PTSA will be needed to pay for the event. Once you have verified that you have obtained the
        funding, fill out any paperwork needed to set up the event. Keep in mind that some in-school
        enrichment programs need at least a month to set up. Please feel free to be creative in your efforts.
    </li>
    <li>Please keep a record of the guest speakers and programs that you have set up in the Record Keeping
        section of this manual.

<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Guest speakers</div>
<p>
    The teacher may ask for guest speakers that will come into the class room and talk about a variety of subjects.
    The speaker may have a career that is relevant to a subject the class is studying (IE: Author, Researcher,
    Firefighter etc.…) or they may have traveled to a specific country the students are studying and can share
    pictures and experiences they had. Usually guest speakers will not be charging a fee and are parents or
    residents of the community who are willing to come in to the school and share their knowledge with the class.
    If you cannot find one who is local you may need to research online to find one that does charge a fee. You
    may be able to set up a Skype presentation using the smart boards in the classroom. Usually Skype
    presentations are less expensive than having someone come to the school. You can find speakers from across
    the country and in some cases the world. To determine which guest speakers are needed for the year fill out
    the Guest Speaker/enrichment Worksheet form in the back of this manual with the teacher. Occasionally the
    teacher may email you with a need that was not discussed at the beginning of the year, feel free to
    accommodate that.
</p>

<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Ideas for finding Guest Speakers</div>
<ul>
    <li>Email the parents to see if they or someone they know is willing to come in to the school to share their
        expertise on a relevant topic.
    </li>
    <li>Reach out to the PTSA for help</li>
    <li>Ask for a specific speaker in the schools Friday Flyer or ask the Principal to send out an E blast to the
        parents.
    </li>
    <li>Put a small article in the Mountain Messenger to see if there are members of the community that can help
        or ask for the local churches to see if any of their members can help.
    </li>
    <li>Call or email the local universities, colleges and museums to see if they have someone that can do
        outreach or have kits they loan to schools.
    </li>
    <li>Google speakers for the topics needed. Many of the National Museums do Skype presentations.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Enrichment Programs or Field trips</div>
<p>
    Enrichment programs are usually outside groups that come into the school to do hands on presentations to
    the class. Usually they are for science and social studies. Some groups may utilize Skype to do their
    presentation. Most of these type presentations will require at least a month to set up and there will be a fee
    associated with them. The number of outreach programs that each grade level can have will be dependent on
    the funds available in any given year, so it is important to determine which units the teachers feel would
    benefit the most from these outreach programs. Some of the national museums, like the Smithsonian in
    Washington DC may offer free Skype presentations for study units.

<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Setting up the Guest Speakers/Enrichment
    Programs
</div>
<ul>
    <li>After you find the Guest Speaker/Enrichment Program email the teacher with the information and ask
        if they want to set up the speaker or if they want you to set them up.
    </li>
    <li>If the teacher says that they will make the call then make sure that you follow up. Our teachers are very
        busy and sometimes struggle to find the time to make the call. You may have to make several reminder
        emails or calls.
    </li>
    <li>If the teacher asks you to set up the guest speaker, you may want to get several dates and times that the
        speaker can come in. Email the teacher with the date, time, speakers name and contact information.
    </li>
    <li>If the speaker has never been to the school before make sure to give them directions, the schools phone
        number (in case of last minute cancelations) and the teachers name and grade.
    </li>
    <li>Email the schools secretary to let her know to expect the guest speaker and if she would direct them to
        the classroom. Give the speaker instructions on how to get into the building (they must use the call box
        to the right of the main entrance) and that they need to sign in at the office.
    </li>
</ul>
<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Classroom Enrichment Fund</div>
<p>
    The Classroom Enrichment Fund is voluntary donations made by the parents of Middle Level students. The
    money you collect can only be used for Middle Level enrichment and is up to the teachers to choose how to
    use it. It will be managed and distributed by the PTSA Treasurer. Please ask the parents to make donations in
    the form of a check and write middle level enrichment in the memo area of their check. Once you have
    collected the checks then please make arrangements to get them to the PTSA Treasurer.
</p>

<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">How to set up payments for Guest Speakers and
    Enrichment Programs
</div>
<p>
    Once you get approval from the PTSA to pay for a speaker/program and have set it up, email the Speaker or
    Outreach Program to request an invoice. The group or individual may send you or the teacher a confirmation
    packet that will include an invoice. You can email the PTSA treasurer and make arrangements on how to get
    the invoice to her/him.
</p>

<p>
    There are occasions when it may be easier for you to pay out of pocket and then turn in the receipt for

    reimbursement from the PTSA. Just make sure that you have Ok’d the funds from the PTSA in advance. Once

    you have a paid receipt then submit it to the PTSA Treasurer and he/she will send you a check.
</p>

<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Sample Introduction Letter</div>

<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Record Keeping Log</div>
<p>
    In order to make it easier for the future Enrichment Coordinators we are asking you to keep a record of guest
    speakers and outside enrichment programs that you schedule. Please use the following format:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Classroom topic</li>
    <li>Name of guest speaker/ enrichment program and contact information</li>
    <li>Cost</li>
    <li>A short entry on how the program went and if the teacher(s) would like to schedule this
        speaker/program again
    </li>
    <li>Example</li>
</ul>
<p>Topic: Science of Motion</p>

<p>Program: Denver Museum of Science and Nature, emailed school outreach program</p>

<p>Cost: $160. For 29 kids</p>

<p>Had to ask the museum to alter program for grades 1-2., the program was originally for grades 3-4. Teacher
    would like to plan as an opportunity every other year.</p>
