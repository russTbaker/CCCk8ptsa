<div align="center"><h1>Third and Fourth Grades Classroom Volunteer Coordinator Handbook</h1></div>
<hr size="1">
<p>Thank you so much for volunteering to be the Classroom Volunteer Coordinator for the third and fourth
    grade. As Volunteer Coordinator you will be working closely with the Teachers and the PTSA to recruit and
    schedule volunteers in the classroom and for PTSA events. Almost all of your job will be done at home using
    Volunteer Spot, an online scheduling website. While there is some set up time at the beginning of the year,
    Volunteer Spot makes it very easy to manage your classroom volunteers. Basically it will do a lot of the work
    for you. The PTSA has set up this handbook to help guide you through the process. Please feel free to email or
    call the PTSA Volunteer Coordinator with any questions or for support.</p>

<div align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Basic Calendar</div>
<div align="left" style="font-weight:bold">September:</div>
<ul>
    <li> Email the teachers to introduce yourself and send them your contact information. Set up a time to meet</li>
    with the teachers to fill out the Volunteer Needs Worksheet.</li>
    <li> View the online tutorials for using Volunteer Spot sign up at <a href="www.Volunteerspot.com/video/videotour"/>VolunteerSpot.com</a>

    </li>
    <li> Meet with the PTSA Volunteer Coordinator to get Parent/ Community Volunteers email list and to set
        up the Volunteer Spot calendar for the school year. This can be done via email or you can arrange a
        time to meet in the evening. If this is your first time as Classroom Volunteer Coordinator it may be
        better to meet in person.
    </li>
</ul>
<div align="left" style="font-weight:bold">September thru May:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Classroom Volunteers: Send an introduction email to the entire Parent/ Community Volunteers to let them
        know who you are and your contact information (see sample introduction email).
    </li>
    <li>Send monthly reminders to your email list advising them of opportunities available for classroom volunteers.
    </li>
    <li>PTSA Volunteers: the PTSA Volunteer Coordinator may ask that you help recruit grade level volunteers for
        school wide events. Again this will be done online and at home.
    </li>
</ul>

<div style="font-weight:bold">May:</div>

<p>Please fill out the record keeping section of this manual and make arrangements to return it to the PTSA
    Volunteer
    Coordinator.</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold">Classroom Volunteers</div>
<p>
    Classroom volunteers consist of Parents/ Community Volunteers that come in to the classroom to assist the
    teachers with a variety of duties from clerical to one on one help with the students. Each of the teachers may
    have different needs. Every effort will be made to have the volunteer needs of the teachers prior to you
    starting your position. There may be volunteers who will come into the classroom consistently every week on
    the same day for the whole year, some twice a month and some twice a year.
</p>

<p>
    To manage your volunteers we request that you use the on line sign-up service called Volunteer Spot. This
    will make your job extremely easy and allow the PTSA to keep a record of the number of volunteers in each
    classroom. It will also allow the PTSA Community Volunteer Coordinator to easily place Community
    Volunteers that sign up during the school year.
</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold">Volunteer Spot set up</div>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Go to www.volunteerspot.com</li>
    <li>Look on the right hand side of the blue toolbar and click on register.</li>
    <li>Under “I would like to” click “register an organizer account”</li>
    <li>Finish filling out the requested info.</li>
    <li>Once you have completed registering, email the PTSA Volunteer Coordinator that you have an
        account and they will set you up as the Class Coordinator. This can be done in person or via email.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    We highly recommend that you view the online tutorials available at Volunteer Spot (www.
    Volunteerspot.com/video/videotour). After you have viewed the tutorials you can start with your online sign
    up. If you have any questions or just would like support setting up the school year, please feel free to call
    the
    PTSA Volunteer Coordinator to set up a time that you can get together at night after work.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have set up the online sign up with Volunteer Spot your job is easy. You simply need to send out a
    monthly email message on the 20th
    of every month to advise the Parents /Community Volunteers which spots
    are available. We recommend that you set up a reminder on your computer, cell phone, IPod/Pad or tablet for
    this. Volunteer Spot will then send out reminders to the volunteers and a status report to the teachers for the
    following week.

</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold">PTSA Volunteers</div>
<p>
    The PTSA Volunteer Coordinator may ask that you send out an online sign up through Volunteers Spot for
    school wide events. We would like to have a few volunteers from each of the grade levels for Fall Festival,
    Holiday Concerts and the Variety Show. When this happens you will be emailed instructions on what to do.
</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold">Record Keeping</div>
<p>
    Please add the Volunteer needs work sheet to the record keeping section of this handbook. This will help the
    next Classroom Volunteer Coordinator.
