<div class="handbook-worksheet-title">Getting Started</div>
<ol>
    <li>The first step is to email or meet with the teachers.
        <ul>
            <li>Try and do this as soon as possible so you may discuss what parties they would
                like to have for the year. Try to obtain specific dates and times if available.
            </li>
            <li>Inquire about the number of students, any known food allergies and what type
                of food and crafts the teachers prefer to have.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Distribute a letter to the classroom parents introducing you as the Room parent and
        requesting classroom donations for parties.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>At the beginning of the year, room parents send home a letter of introduction to the parents
    and ask for a one time donation to cover the cost of crafts for the parties. We find that you get a
    better response if you send it home in the Friday Folder. Food and paper goods requests should
    be made one week prior to the parties.</p>

<div class="handbook-worksheet-title">Sample introduction letter</div>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>

<p>My name is (insert name) and I have volunteered to be the Room Parent for Grades 3-4. I will
    be helping the teachers with coordinating the class parties. We will be using Volunteer Spot, an
    on line sign up, to inform you of opportunities to donate food, paper goods and volunteer for
    the parties. Typically we have a craft and or activity at the party. In order to fund this, we ask
    that each family donate $5.00 to the class party fund. Please send your donation in a sealed
    envelope with my name on it in your child’s Friday folder.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Your Name</p>

<p>Your email</p>

<p>Your phone Number</p>
